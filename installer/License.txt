d) include contents in malicious, deceptive or unlawful programs; 
e) modify or distribute the Source Code of any of the Distributed Software so that any part of it becomes subject to an Free Software License.  A “Free Software License” shall mean any software license that requires as a condition of use, modification, adaptation or distribution of such licensed software that other software derived from, distributed with or incorporated into at the source code level be disclosed or distributed in Source Code form. By way of example, Free Software License includes the following licenses or distribution models, or licenses or distribution models similar to any of the following: (a) GNU’s General Public License (GPL) or Lesser/Library GPL (LGPL), (b) The Artistic License (e.g., PERL), (c) the Mozilla Public License, (d) the Netscape Public License, (e) the Sun Community Source License (SCSL), and (f) the Sun Industry Standards Source License (SISSL);

Accordingly, if You provide Feedback, You agree AMD and its Licensees may freely use, reproduce, license, distribute, and otherwise commercialize the Feedback in the Materials or other technologies. You further agree not to provide any Feedback that (i) You know is subject to any patent, copyright or other intellectual property claim or right of any third party or (ii) is subject to license terms which seek to require any products incorporating or derived from such Feedback, or other AMD intellectual property, to be licensed to any third party or released in source code form or subject to any Free Software License.

7. Confidentiality. You shall refrain from disclosing any Confidential Information to third parties and You will take reasonable security precautions, at least as great as the precautions You take to protect Your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable care, to keep confidential the Confidential Information.

You will only disclose the Confidential Information to its employees or on-site subcontractors (i) who have a need to know in furtherance of the purpose stated above and (ii) who have signed a confidentiality agreement with You at least as restrictive as this Agreement.  If at any future time AMD, directly or indirectly, discloses any other related technology or information to You, including without limitation any updated versions of the Materials, such disclosure will also be deemed to be confidential, part of the Materials and will be subject to the provisions of this Agreement. You may disclose Confidential Information in accordance with a judicial or other governmental order, provided that You gives AMD reasonable notice prior to such disclosure to allow AMD a reasonable opportunity to seek a protective order or equivalent.
