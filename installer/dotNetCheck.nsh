# DotNET version checking macro.
# Written by AnarkiNet(AnarkiNet@gmail.com) originally, modified by eyal0 (for use in http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/itwister)
# Downloads and runs the Microsoft .NET Framework version 2.0 Redistributable and runs it if the user does not have the correct version.
# To use, call the macro with a string:
# !insertmacro CheckDotNET "2"
# !insertmacro CheckDotNET "2.0.9"
# (Version 2.0.9 is less than version 2.0.10.)
# All register variables are saved and restored by CheckDotNet
# No output
