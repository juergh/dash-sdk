Previous Release - v1.1.0a (07/15/08)

	* Putty is removed from the SDK and user is required to download putty. (Update pre-request for SDK).
	* OpenSSL is decoupled from SDK and user is required to install openssl.(Update pre-request for SDK).

	* Fixed a bug in MOF compiler when method parameter is input & output.
	* Removed warnings generated by OAL header files(Mof compiler generated files).
	* Modified mof compiler to fix warnings from mof compiler generated cod.
	* Removed unused low level API's enumClass, enumClassNames, execQuery
	* Added an option to SKD library to specify an input file with class name, key properties information.
	  This is to construct the object path from instance when EnumerateMode=EnumerateEPR is not supported
	  by the DASH target.
	* SDK is converted to use VC++ express edition 2008 from VC++ express edition 2005.
	* enumerateInstances is used instead of enumerateInstanceNames always, this is changed to use 
	  enumerateInstances only when enumerateInstanceNames is not supported.
	* SDK library was using wrong runtime flags, now its chaged to use /MT* flag for static and /MD* for 
	  dynamic library.
	* Changed the resource URI for associators and reference to "http://schemas.dmtf.org/wbem/wscim/1/*".
	* Fixed slow response issue on linux when the http data size is more than 1024 bytes. This is due to
