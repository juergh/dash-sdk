       "Indicates that the referenced Service is acquired as part of a "
       "Product. Examples of Services that may be acquired are "
       "outsourced storage and networking services, or support and "
       "warranty services. Expanding on the examples, Services "
       "represent generic functionality - so, it is possible to model "
       "the existence of storage volume management or warranty "
       "services as individual instances of subclasses of CIM_Service. "
       "These \'Services\' may be enabled/disabled, started/stopped, "
       "signal an error, etc. (They behave as standard "
       "ManagedSystemElements.) Specific requests against the Services "
       "- for example, a request for warranty service or increased "
       "storage space - are NOT new instances of Service, but may be "
       "requested via the methods of the Service subclass, or be "
       "instantiated as specific subclasses of ManagedElement.This "
       "class is maintained for compatibility with existing "
       "implementations, but may be deprecated in favor of "
       "ProductElementComponent in the future." )]
