    Description ( 
       "This association define StorageSettings that reflect the "
       "capabilities of the associated StorageCapabilities. The "
       "associated StorageSetting may not define the operational "
       "characteristics (through settings properties) of any storage "
       "element. StorageSettingsGeneratedFromCapabilities is the "
       "association between instances of StorageCapabilities and those "
       "instances of StorageSetting that have been created from the "
       "StorageCapabilities instance using the StorageCapabilities "
       "\"CreateSetting\" method. These settings have a "
       "StorageSetting.ChangeableType of \"Changeable - Transient\" or "
       "\"Changeable - Persistent\" The settings associated by this "
       "class reflect the capabilities from which they are generated. "
       "These setting SHALL be associated with one "
       "StorageCapabilities. \n"
       "A generated setting can be deleted by the implementation at "
       "any time if it is a a StorageSetting of \"Changed - Transient\" "
       "ChangeableType. \n"
       "A client should not use this association to find transient "
       "Settings to subsequently modify and/or use because that would "
       "increase the likelihood of setting contention across clients. "
       "Instead the implementation uses this association to define "
       "transient settings, which can be located through any means, "
       "that have special temporal based life cycle. \n"
       "DefaultSetting is meaningless in this class." )]
