1.5.0

Openwsman 1.5 is an interim stable release toward 2.0 with all completed features since 1.0. This release serves as a checkpoint to evaluate implemented and outstanding features and to take care of bugs instead of waiting until the beta phase of 2.0.

    * Structure Improvements
          o New file structure. Header files separated from source file
          o wsman_util library integrated into main library
          o CIM client library (relying on SFCC) is part of the CIM plugin now 
    * Openwsman Server:
          o Rename server binary to openwsmand to avoid conflicts (wsmand is very generic)
          o Accept indications 
    * Openwsman Client:
          o Added --encoding options to choose encoding type of sent and received messages
          o Added options to support eventing
          o Load custom method parameters from external file 
    * WS-Eventing Phase 1
          o Subscribe, Unsubscribe, Renew commands supported
          o Heartbeat message supported. The granularity is 1 second.
          o Four kinds of delivery modes supported: Push, PushWithAck, Pull, Events
          o Extensible subscription storage mechanism and local subscription storage implemented
          o If the delivery mode is PushWithAck or Events and there is no acknowledgment response from the event sink, the subscription will be terminated.
          o Expired subscription will be deleted from the storage.
          o Subscription with no expiry time will be kept until the service restarts. When the service restarts, all expired and non-expiry subscriptions will be deleted.
          o If the delivery mode is set to Pull, the number of events kept in the service is limited. Any events over that limit will be discarded.
          o Initial CIM indication support in the CIM plugin 
    * XML abstraction layer and parser improvements
    * Language Bindings:
          o Python 
    * Better support for windows authentication and client API support on windows
    * Windows Client-side WS-Eventing support:
    * C++ Bindings (Interface use mostly on windows)
          o Connect using proxy server.
          o Support replacing user name without the need to call constructor. Added api - void SetUserName?(const char *user_name)
          o Support replacing password without the need to call constructor. Added api - void SetPassword?(const char *password)
          o Add mechanism to extract error message (as string) using the error code inside the GeneralWsmanExeption?.
          o Fixed bugs related to Kerberos communication in windows transport client 
    * Integration with CIMOMs:
          o Sfc Broker (Support local and CIMXML communication): Now it is possible to choose backend in the configuration file
          o Openwbem (External Request handler) 

    * Many many other fixes and improvements

    * cleanup API to support external plugins and openwbem request handler
    * General cleanup and minor fixes
