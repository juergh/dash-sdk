1. Introduction.
-----------------


The open source DASH SDK is released under AMD Modified BSD License. It provides software in source and binary form to allow management consoles and management applications to support the Distributed Management Task Force DASH interface.

The SDK consists of two top-level components:

a) Low-level APIs that expose all DASH-related CIM(Common Information Model) properties and methods.  This allows full access to all DASH capabilities.

b) High-level APIs for common operations such as discovery, power-on/off, and basic inventory.  The high-level API is an abstraction layer and minimizes the exposure of the console to details of the low-level DASH protocol stack.

This document describes how to build and getting started with DASH SDK for Windows and Linux Operating Systems.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Windows Build.
-----------------


2.1. Prerequisites for building the SDK under windows.
------------------------------------------------------

a) Get Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 express edition.
  - Download the installer from the link below:
    http://www.microsoft.com/express/download/
  - Follow the installer's instructions. 

b) Get Perl
  - Download and Install ActivePerl from the below link: 
    http://www.activestate.com/Products/activeperl/index.mhtml
  - Other versions of perl might work as well, but are not officially
    supported.
  - During the setup, ActivePerl asks whether it should be added to the PATH environment variable; activate this checkbox
  - If you didn't check this, add the directory manually to the PATH
    Environment:
    Control Panel -> System -> Advanced -> Environment Variables.
    Select "PATH" in the system variables box -> Edit.
    Add the path of the "bin" directory of the perl installation to the end of the existing path

c) Get Putty.
  - Download putty from link below. (Only needed for text redirection).
    http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html.
  - Set the path to putty.exe in the system.
    Control Panel -> System -> Advanced -> Environment Variables.
    Select "PATH" in the system variables box -> Edit.
    Add the path (directory where the putty.exe is located) to end of existing
    path. 

d) Get NSIS, the NullSoft Installer
  - Download NSIS from the link below. (Only needed to build the installer)
    http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page
  - Install the NSIS package
  - Add NSIS install directory to the PATH environment variable
    Control Panel -> System -> Advanced -> Environment Variables.
    Select "PATH" in the system variables box -> Edit.
    Add the path (NSIS Install directory) to end of existing path. 
    
  - copy inetc dll to nsis plugin folder: http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Inetc_plug-in
  - extract EnvVarUpdate plugin to nsis include folder:
    http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Environmental_Variables:_append%2C_prepend%2C_and_remove_entries#Function_Code

2.2. Build Instructions.
------------------------

a) Download the latest release of DASH SDK.

b) Open the solution.
  - Start the VC++ IDE and open the solution file:
    File -> Open -> Project/Solution, select: windows/dash/dash.sln
    This solution has the following projects:
      dashcli (application)
      dashapi (library)
      dashapic (C library)
	  eventsink (library)      
	  installer (the Windows installer)
	  libxml2 (library)
	  mof2oal (tool for generating C++ files from mof file)
	  openssl (library)      
	  OpenWsmanLib (library)
      ssl_client 
      webserver
	  wsman_client_lib (libarary)
       
    These projects can also be built individually using the project specific   solution file.

c) First build.
  - Click Build-> Batch Build, select all projects (Select All button) and press Build. That builds all projects (application and library) and copies the executable to "windows/win32pkg" directory. This includes all application, library and dependent dll's concerning release build as well as debug build.
  - Please note that the installer requires that all other projects  are built in both "Debug" and "Release" configuration
  - The installer is copied into the "installer" directory


2.3. Debugging.
---------------

a) Open the solution.
  - Open the windows/dash/dash.sln solution file in VC++ IDE (like described above).
  - Build the solution if necessary (like described above).
b) Start debugging.
  - Select the desired project.
    Do a right click on your desired project and select "Set as StartUp Project".
  - Start debugging.
    Use F5 to run the selected project in normal debug mode. With F10/F11 you may debug by stepping over/into the code gradually.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Linux Build.
---------------


3.1. Prerequisites for building the SDK under Linux.
----------------------------------------------------

a) x86 PC with any distribution of Linux installed. (Currently Suse Enterprise Edition 11.1/Redhat/Fedora is verified).

c) Install libxml2, libcurl, openssl, python development packages.
--------------------------------------------------------------
Development Packages required for Suse Enterprise Edition 11.1
--------------------------------------------------------------
1.	Python-devel
2.	libopen-ssl-devel
3.	zlib-devel
4.	readline-devel
5.	ncurses-devel
6.	tack
7.	libxml2-devel

d) Install ssh client and telnet client (Only needed for text redirection).


3.2. Build Instructions.
------------------------

a) Download the latest release of DASH SDK.

b) From the command prompt change to the root directory of DASH SDK.

c) Install DASH SDK.
